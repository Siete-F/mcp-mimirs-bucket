# Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

The Mimir's Bucket MCP Server has been refactored from a monolithic design to a modular package structure. This improves maintainability, testability, and overall code organization.

### Key Achievements

1. **Modular Package Structure**: Organized code into logical modules in a proper Python package
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Separated database access, MCP server, tools, and search functionality
3. **Improved Configuration**: Better handling of configuration and environment variables
4. **Script Organization**: Moved utility scripts to a dedicated scripts directory
5. **Type Safety**: Improved type annotations throughout the codebase
6. **Cleanup**: Created scripts to remove the old, redundant files after refactoring

### Original Files vs New Structure

| Original File | New Structure |
|---------------|--------------|
| `arango_document_api.py` | `mimirs_bucket/db/client.py` and `mimirs_bucket/db/models.py` |
| `mcp_knowledge_db.py` | `mimirs_bucket/tools/document_tools.py`, `mimirs_bucket/tools/search_tools.py`, `mimirs_bucket/tools/topic_tools.py` |
| `update_embeddings.py` | `scripts/update_embeddings.py` |

## How to Use the Refactored Project

1. Review the `REFACTORING.md` file for detailed documentation about the changes
2. Now use `main.py` or the `mimirs-bucket` command to run the server

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to understand and maintain
2. **Better Testability**: Clear module boundaries make unit testing simpler
3. **Improved Collaboration**: Team members can work on different modules with less risk of conflicts
4. **Code Reuse**: Better organized code makes it easier to reuse components in other projects
5. **Extensibility**: Easier to add new features by extending existing modules
